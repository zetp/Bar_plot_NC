# Bar plot with indicated data points
Aim: make Shiny app to allow for easy creation of bar plots that fulfil requirements of Nature Communications journal:
"Please ensure that the corresponding dot plots are overlaid in the bar charts"
Using R and Shiny - seems to be nice project for my first shiny app.

PointBar is now available [here](http://adz.ibb.waw.pl/pointbar/).
The detailed ReadMe is included in the application itself.
